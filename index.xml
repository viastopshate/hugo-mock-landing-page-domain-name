This is the main reason Hugo 0.119.0 is released sooner rather than later. But this release also comes with a dependency refresh and some useful image processing improvements:
A new general-purpose Process method and filter. A new Opacity filter.

The Blackfriday support was removed in Hugo v0.100.0 after being deprecated with a warning for a long time.
v0.100.1 fix panic with markdownify/RenderString with shortcode on Page with no content file.
$page.RenderString (see #6703) finally supports shortcodes, and shortcode improvements is the main theme in Hugo 0.100.0.
